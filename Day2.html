<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkD20ajVxnY" target = "_blank"> <i>Tim McGraw</i> </a>
Swift began her journey in the music industry in 2006. Releasing the self titled debut album, followed <em>Fearless</em> and <em>Speak Now</em>. She then experimented with pop in some songs on her next album, <em>Red</em>. <em>1989</em> came after that. Hit Singles such as <em>Bad blood</em> and <em>Shake it off</em> could be heard on every radio.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Due to some controversies, she took a break from the music industry and focussed on herself. <strong>She came back stronger than a 90's trend!</strong>
</p>
<br>

<p>
<em>Reputation</em> album was one the greatest comeback of all time! All her posts from her social media were deleted, symbolising a fresh start. She did this before also before releasing 1989, her first complete pop album, she cut her hair, marking her transition from country sweetheart to a Pop star. She embraced the hate and turned it into the amazing album it is. The reputation tour marked Swift's most successful tour to-date, and broke many records, such as becoming the highest-grossing tour ever in the United States and North America.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Right now, releasing indie folk music in albums such as <em>Folklore</em> and <em>Evermore </em>she is showing off her extreme versatility. She is also re recording her past albums.

Taylor Swift is a very inspiring icon. She always puts her best foot forward despite the situations. She turns adverses situations into opportunities. She is very talented and makes great music. I have listened to her music a lot and look upto her as a role model. I look forward to her upcoming projects and I'm sure she will continue to surprise us!
